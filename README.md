# Hey, I'm Raghav! 👋

Thanks for stopping by!

Currently, I'm building [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/agents)' voice agents platform, and in my free time, I develop and scale [StudyKit](https://studykit.app) to over one hundred thousand users.

Before that, I studied computer science and mathematics at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/), interning at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/gotham/), [Google](https://www.android.com/auto/), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) along the way.

While probably sparser now that I'm working full time, my Github has many of my experiments in web ML, frontend and AI dev tooling, as well as past hackathon projects.
