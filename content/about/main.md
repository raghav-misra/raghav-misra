I'm Raghav, a full-stack web developer+, studying at Amador Valley High School. Currently, I'm an intern at [Hack+](https://hackplus.io) and a programming instructor at [theCoderSchool](https://www.thecoderschool.com).
Outside of school, I spend the majority of my time working on side projects, learning new concepts, and competing in hackathons.

Nearly all of my projects are cross-platform web apps, written end-to-end in JavaScript and TypeScript.
I build modular, component-driven frontends in Vue and NuxtJS, and design them to perfection with Figma.
On the other side of the stack, I write REST APIs with NodeJS and Express and use MongoDB for data storage.

I am passionate about developing applications that can make a change, and with my apps, I strive to solve problems that exist in today's world.
