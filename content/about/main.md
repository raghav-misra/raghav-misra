I'm Raghav, a full-stack web developer. Currently, I'm studying at Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, CA. 
Outside of school, I spend the majority of my time working on side projects, learning new concepts, and competing in hackathons.

Nearly all of my projects are cross-platform web apps, written end-to-end in JavaScript and TypeScript. 
I build modular, component-driven frontends in Vue and NuxtJS, and design them to perfection with Figma. 
On the other side of the stack, I write REST APIs with NodeJS and Express and use MongoDB for data storage.

I enjoy developing applications that have the potential to make a change, and many of my apps solve (and will solve)
medical or education-related problems.
