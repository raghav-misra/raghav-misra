  "body": "### JavaScript and More\n\nTypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the world’s most used tools, by adding static type definitions.\n\nTypes provide a way to *describe the shape of an object*, pro**viding better d**ocumentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.\n\n> Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, because type inference allows you to get a lot of power without writing additional code.\n>\n> *\\--- Big Shaq, 1995*\n\n### A Result You Can Trust\n\nAll valid JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. You might get type-checking errors, but that won't stop you from running the resulting JavaScript. While you can go for stricter behavior, that means you're still in control.\n\nTypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). This JavaScript is clean, simple code which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.JS or in your apps.\n\n### Gradual Adoption\n\nAdopting TypeScript is **not a binary** choice, you can start by annotating existing JavaScript with JSDoc, then switch a few files to be checked by TypeScript and over time prepare your codebase to convert completely.\n\nTypeScript’s type inference means that you don’t have to annotate your code until you want more safety."
